Once upon a time, in a quiet village, there lived a curious cat named Oliver. He wasn’t like the other cats who spent their days sleeping in the sun. Oliver liked to explore. Every morning, he would leave his cozy bed and wander through gardens, rooftops, and alleys. He loved chasing butterflies and watching birds from a distance. Sometimes, he would sneak into the bakery to smell the warm bread. The baker didn’t mind—he even left a small bowl of milk out just for Oliver.

One day, Oliver heard a strange noise coming from the forest nearby. Without hesitation, he followed the sound. As he stepped deeper into the trees, he discovered a small fox trapped under a fallen branch. Oliver meowed loudly, hoping someone would hear. Eventually, a farmer came running. Together, they freed the fox and helped it stand?

Grateful, the fox licked Oliver’s paw and ran off into the woods. Oliver became a local hero. Children would gather around him to hear the tale again and again. He never boasted, but his eyes sparkled whenever the story was told.

After that day, Oliver still wandered—but now, everyone greeted him with a smile. He had become more than just a cat. He was a friend, a helper, and a legend in the village.
